# From Tax To Equality

## Using the quarto document (HA_Justice.qmd) in RStudio
The qmd. should be able to import the final dataset "equaltax_balanced.csv" from the directory when running in RStudio and perform all calculations. In addition, the results of the calculations can be viewed in the HTML document and all steps can be retraced. During the editing process, various data sets were tested in different configurations. Remnants of these are still present in the code. The correct data set used for the analysis was created at the end of the "Data Preparation" chapter. This can be easily imported from chapter 3 "Descriptive Statistics" and used for all subsequent analyses. The preparation code therefore does not need to be executed separately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The entire folder **"Schwarz_TaxtoEquality_HA-Replication "** must be opened as a project in R and it must have been completely downloaded beforehand. After downloading the folder, the **"HA_Justice.Rproj "** file (R project) must therefore be opened. The **HA_Justice.qmd** file (Quarto document) can then be opened and used within RStudio under "**Files**".
